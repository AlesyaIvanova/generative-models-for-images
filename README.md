# Generative Models for Realistic Bird Images

This repository contains the source code and a detailed report on training a model to generate **realistic bird images**. 

The model was trained on the [100-bird-species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) dataset and implements the [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) architecture.

The training report, which includes the methodology, results, and key insights, is provided in the file [Generative_models_for_images.pdf](https://github.com/AlesyaIvanova/generative-models-for-images/blob/main/Generative_models_for_images.pdf).
